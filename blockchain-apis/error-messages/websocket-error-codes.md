| 1001            | Indicates that an endpoint is "going away", such as a server going down or a browser having navigated away from a page.                                                                                                          |
| 1002            | Indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection due to a protocol error.                                                                                                                                                |
| 1003            | <p>Indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection</p><p>because it has received a type of data it cannot accept (e.g., an endpoint that understands only text data MAY send this if it receives a binary message).</p> |
| 1004            | Reserved                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1005            | Indicates that no status code was actually present.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1006            | <p>Indicates that the connection was closed abnormally, e.g., without sending or</p><p>receiving a Close control frame.</p>                                                                                                      |
| 1007            | <p>Indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection</p><p>because it has received data within a message that was not consistent with the type of the message (e.g., non-UTF-8 data within a text message)</p>            |
| 1008            | <p>Indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection</p><p>because it has received a message that violates its policy.</p>                                                                                                |
| 1009            | <p>Indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection</p><p>because it has received a message that is too big for it to process.</p>                                                                                       |
| 1010            | Indicates that the client endpoint is terminating the connection as the server did not respond.                                                                                                                                  |
| 1011            | Indicates that a server is terminating the connection because it encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.                                                                              |
