# Arbitrum

## The Arbitrum Network

**Arbitrum** is a Layer 2 cryptocurrency platform that makes smart contracts scalable, fast, and private. Arbitrum interoperates closely with Ethereum, so Ethereum developers can easily cross-compile their contracts to run on Arbitrum.\
Arbitrum achieves these goals through a unique combination of incentives, network protocol design, and virtual machine architecture.[ ](https://offchainlabs.com)
