# Terra

Terra is a global blockchain payment network and DeFi system built on top of Cosmos. At its core are a family of stablecoins pegged to the world's major currencies allowing users to transact instantly, worldwide, and at lower fees. The system adjusts its supply algorithmically according to demand to ensure the price stability of its digital currencies.
