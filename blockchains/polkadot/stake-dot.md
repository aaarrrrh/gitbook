# Stake DOT

## **Why Stake DOT With Parachain Bonds? **

With Internet Bonds, Ankr will stake your DOT tokens with our validator nodes while giving you back aDOTb bond tokens. This is a reward-earning bond token that will distribute staking rewards to your wallet daily.&#x20;

In addition to earning rewards, you can use aDOTb to generate even more passive income when using it to perform liquidity mining, lending, and other methods on DeFi platforms like Uniswap or Compound.&#x20;

* **Instant liquidity for your staked DOT** - With aDOTb tokens, you can earn in more places while still receiving staking rewards. Access DeFi applications on both Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain.&#x20;
* **Earn High Yields** - Parachain Bonds can earn high yield than staking DOT because rewards distributed from winning projects to DOT contributors are expected to be significantly higher than DOT staking rewards
* **Support and secure the Polkadot network** - Staking DOT directly supports the Polkadot platform and helps validate transactions on the network.&#x20;

### Security & Safety

Keep all funds in your own wallets and hold custody of your keys at all times.
