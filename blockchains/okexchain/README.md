# OKExChain

## **The OKExChain**

**OKExChain** is open-source, public blockchain technology developed by [OKEx](https://www.okex.com) for building blockchain-based trading applications. It is designed to establish a safe and efficient decentralized-finance architecture that can be used to create a decentralized exchange, or DEX, that features community-based operations, transparent trading rules and allows the users to control their own assets.
