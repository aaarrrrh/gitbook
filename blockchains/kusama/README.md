Kusama is a canary network for developers to test the Polkadot ecosystem. Kusama is owned by KSM token holders, there is no central kill switch.\
\
Kusama is an open-source platform that developers use to launch highly decentralized applications, new DeFi products, and new interoperable blockchains. It also gives users the ability to launch Ethereum applications with incredible throughput that can process thousands of transactions per second.\
