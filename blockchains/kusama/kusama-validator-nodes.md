# Kusama Validator Nodes

## **Validator Nodes **

If you have access to a larger amount of KSM, you may want to consider having your own staking (validator) node. With a validator node, you contribute directly to the security of the Kusama network and get rewarded with KSM tokens in return. Set one up easily with Ankr — no technical knowledge required.&#x20;
