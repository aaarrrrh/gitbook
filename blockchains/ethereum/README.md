# Ethereum

## **The Ethereum Network**

The Ethereum network is one of the most popular platforms for building decentralized applications and blockchain solutions. With Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity, it switched to a Proof-of-Stake consensus model that allows investors to stake ETH and earn rewards for supporting the network. Staking ETH contributes to securing the Ethereum network and ultimately the Ethereum ecosystem. It also earns you new ETH in the process as a reward for your staking activities.
