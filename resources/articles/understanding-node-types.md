# Understanding Node Types

Nodes are the devices and software used by individuals, organizations and institutions in a network to keep a copy of a blockchain and serve as communication points that execute various essential network functions.

## Full <a href="full" id="full"></a>

**Full nodes** are nodes that download the entire blockchain and validate each transaction per the agreed‐upon rules of the network, relaying transactions and blocks to others.

## Archive <a href="archive" id="archive"></a>

**Archive nodes** store the full history of in-blockchain interactions (transactions, account balances, blockchain metrics etc.). Archive nodes are suitable for tracking the processes that occur in a blockchain within a predetermined period of time. This can be useful if you want to create a dApp based on an understanding of historical data.

## Validator <a href="validator" id="validator"></a>

**Validator** nodes are a group or a piece of IT infrastructure that takes the responsibility of maintaining Chain data and validating all transactions. They join the consensus protocol and vote to produce blocks. The fees are collected and distributed among all validators.
