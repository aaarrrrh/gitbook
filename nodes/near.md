# Near

NEAR is a decentralized smart contract platform that is easy to use and scales to power an open web that everyday people can use. NEAR utilizes sharding to increase transaction throughput and is secured by a novel Proof-of-stake mechanism with three types of validators.

* Chunk producers: collect transactions for the shard while producing and communicating shard blocks (chunks).
* Block producers: Produce a block containing all current chunks.
