## **Step 1: Wallets** <a href="step-1-wallets" id="step-1-wallets"></a>

If you don’t have an LTO Network wallet you can create one at [https://wallet.lto.network.](https://wallet.lto.network)​

The wallet you just created is (will be) your personal wallet. We’ll want another wallet which we’ll use just for staking. This new wallet will also receive earnings. Go ahead and create another wallet. We’ll use the lease function of the LTO Network to lease your tokens from your personal wallet to the 2nd wallet.

## **Step 2: Leasing** <a href="step-2-leasing" id="step-2-leasing"></a>

The next step is creating your lease. You will want to lease your tokens from your personal wallet (Wallet #1) to your 2nd wallet (the wallet we’ll use for the node).

All done, now you can use the backup phrase of your "Staking wallet" to deploy a node on [app.ankr.com](https://app.ankr.com).
