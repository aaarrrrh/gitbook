# How to run a BSC Node on Erigon

## Introduction&#x20;

This guide will walk you through 3 options for setting up and launching a BSC Node on Erigon.&#x20;

Here are the main benefits of running BSC on Erigon:

* Drastically reduced disk storage - 1.2TB for Archive Node, 430GB for Pruned Node.&#x20;
* Faster sync speed > 10 blocks per second&#x20;
* Fully bootstrapped archive node in <3days.&#x20;
* Crash resilience - Erigonâ€™s database can withstand power failures. Modularity - P2P and web3 RPC services can be run as components.

If you want to be able to run a node without buying vast disk space then Erigon is going to make a massive difference.
