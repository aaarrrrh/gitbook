# Nervos

The **Nervos Network** is an open source public blockchain ecosystem and collection of protocols**.**&#x20;

The **Nervos** blockchain, also known as the Common Knowledge Base (CKB) is the layer 1 proof of work public blockchain protocol of the Nervos Network. It serves as a foundation to build on and provides trust to all layers built on top.&#x20;

Decentralization whilst remaining minimal, flexible and secure is the core design principle. The main purpose is the reliable preservation of any data and assets stored within it.
