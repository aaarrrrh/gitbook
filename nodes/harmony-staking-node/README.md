# Harmony Staking Node

Our Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and double-sign slashing.

Harmony aims to build an open network of nodes operated and governed by a large community. This node community is called Pangaea.

Are we decentralised yet? There’s no consensus without participation. At the moment, the network has a total of 640 slots which are filled by more than 80 validators. Harmony consists of volunteers and validators from more than 100 countries and most of them have never run a node before.
