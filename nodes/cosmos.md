**Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like** [**Tendermint**](https://cosmos.network/intro#what-is-tendermint-core-and-the-abci) **consensus.**

They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of transactions per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision. In order to understa
