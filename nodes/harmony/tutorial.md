3\. The hardware configuration is already set at the optimal system requirements. The

platform also recommends a cluster, which is usually the one that has the most freely

available resources. In this particular case, the recommended cluster is Singapore cluster, but another cluster may be recommended depending on your location.

Specific Node Configuration

4\. The project name is pre-filled. You can change it if you want.

5\. Next, you need to insert a node name in order to identify and get realtime stats of the node on the Harmony Validator Explorer, once your node is elected as a Validator.

6\. In order to deploy the Node, Ankr will generate a BLS Key and a Harmony Wallet for you. For security reasons, these two keys will be encoded with a password that must be set in the Encryption Password field. Please make sure to write this password

somewhere safe in order to regain access to your keys.

If later on, you want to extend the nodeâ€™s run time, you can add funds at any time

8\. Click **Proceed to payment**

13\. In order for your node to be eligible for a validator you will need at least 10.000 ONE Mainnet native tokens in your wallet on Shard 0 and the Node should be synced.

14\. You can click on the the Manage tab to find the amount of tokens available in your wallet.

15\. Once the ONE tokens are visible in your token wallet, you can **Apply** for a Validator spot.\
\
**Please note:** The Apply Button will be grayed out until the node is fully synced and the wallet token balance is higher than 0.
