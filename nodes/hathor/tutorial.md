### **Set up your **NuCypher Worker Node** on Ankr** <a href="2e0e" id="2e0e"></a>

1\. Head to[ app.ankr.com](http://app.ankr.com) to deploy and click the **Deploy A Node **button.

3\. Now you are taken to the configuration page. The hardware configuration is set at the recommended system requirements, but you can choose to increase the specifications if you wish to do so, by using **Advanced** button.

4\. The platform also recommends a cluster, which is usually the one that has the most freely available resources. In this particular case, the recommended cluster is the United Kingdom cluster, but another cluster may be recommended for you, depending on your location.

5\. The **Project Name** for use in the Ankr application is pre-filled. You can change it if you want (please note that only a small set of special characters are allowed in this name).

6\. Choose Network where you want to deploy your node, choose from **Mainnet **or **Testnet**.

7\. To actively participate in the NU Cypher network, the node needs an ETH wallet that should get funded regularly. We can generate one for you and will encrypt it with your desired password, or you can insert your own Keystore. Please make sure to write your password down and keep it in a safe spot, as you will not be able to use your wallet without it.

If later on, you want to extend the nodeâ€™s run time, you can add funds at any time.
