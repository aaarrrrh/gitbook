# Tutorial



In this tutorial, we will show you how to run a TomoChain Masternode.

**Set up the TomoChain Masternode on Ankr**

1. Head to [app.ankr.com](http://app.ankr.com) to deploy and select **Deploy A Node**

3\. Now you are taken to the configuration page. The hardware configuration is already set at the optimal system requirements, but you are allowed to increase the specifications if you wish to do so.

The platform also recommends a cluster, which is usually the one that has the most freely available resources. In this particular case, the recommended cluster is the UK cluster, but another cluster may be recommended depending on your location.

5\. Choose a name for your node you can use letter and number, dashes (“-”) and underscores (“\_”)

6\. Provide your Tomochain Private Key. For security measures, we advise using a new wallet. In order to obtain a new TomoChain Wallet, you can follow [this guide.](https://docs.tomochain.com/general/how-to-connect-to-tomochain-network/tomowallet)

7\. Select the Payment Method, choose the number of months you want to run the node by moving the slider. The price and discount will increase when you extend the run time. &#x20;

If later on, you want to extend the node’s run time, you can add funds at any time

8\. Click **Proceed to payment**

13\. Your TomoChain Masternode is now in the process of being deployed, this process can take approximately 2-3 hours until completion.&#x20;

Once node is fully synced you can follow [this procedure](https://docs.tomochain.com/masternode-and-dex/masternode/apply-your-node) to apply to become a master node candidate.
