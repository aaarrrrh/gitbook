# Elastos

Elastos is building the foundation for a modern, decentralized internet. The ecosystem is compromised of the Elastos blockchain, Elastos ETH sidechains for solidity smart contracts at 500-1500+ tps, a secure P2P network and sandbox (OS) for dApps with decentralized ID solutions and IPFS modules.

The Elastos blockchain uses a hybrid AuxPoW/DPoS consensus. With AuxPow, miners can merge mine ELA while mining Bitcoin, leveraging its hashpower and security. DPoS nodes then validate incoming blocks providing additional security that can filter out faulty blocks in the event that an entity owns 51% of Bitcoin's hash power.
