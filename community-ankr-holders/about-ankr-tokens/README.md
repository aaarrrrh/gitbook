# About ANKR Tokens

### What they are

The ANKR token is the native utility and governance token for the ANKR network. ANKR tokens are used to pay for services within the ANKR ecosystem.

There is a limited supply of 10 billion tokens with approximately 27000 holders of ANKR tokens (as of July 2021).

**Tokenomics** \
There is no inflation built into the ANKR token. For example, a user who owns 1,000,000 ANKR, would own 0.0001% of the total supply. Because there is no inflation, that user’s percentage of the total supply would not change over time.&#x20;

**Circulating Supply**\
Circulating supply refers to the amount of Ankr tokens available for use in the open market. Ankr plans to release the remaining supply for distribution programs, developer grants, and to provide liquidity to future exchange listings. One hundred percent of the token supply is scheduled to be unlocked by August, 2022, though Ankr reserves the right to change this at any time for any reason.

**INITIAL TOKEN SUPPLY**

40%

**UNLOCKED TOKEN SUPPLY**

60% over 36 months between August 2019-August 2022\

#### Why 10 billion tokens?

ANKR chose this amount so that our token holders would not have to do fractional math

It’s estimated there are around 25 million developers in the world today. As adoption increases, it is possible that ANKR could bring 4%, or 1 million developers into the Web 3.0 movement. Hypothetically, if the ANKR token was evenly distributed, 1 million developers could hold a maximum of 10,000 tokens each. This allows us to better utilize the token in whole numbers.

#### **Burned Tokens**

Approximately 2% of Ankr tokens have been[ burned](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8290333cef9e6d528dd5618fb97a76f268f3edd4?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead). At this time, we are unlikely to burn more as it does not fit in with our long term strategy.
