# Avalanche RPC

Avalanche is an **ecosystem** made up of three core Blockchains optimized for specific tasks within the network. The **Exchange Chain** (X-Chain), **Platform Chain** (P-Chain), and **Contract Chain** (C-Chain).&#x20;

All 3 blockchains are validated and secured by the Primary Network.

Avalanche was built specifically with Defi dApps and protocols in mind, focusing on security, low latency & high throughput. Avalanche uses a novel consensus protocol by utilizing two different consensus mechanisms. The consensus protocol ensures a high degree of security and fast finality even with multiple chains running simultaneously.
