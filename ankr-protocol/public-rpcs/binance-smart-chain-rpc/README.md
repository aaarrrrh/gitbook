# Binance Smart Chain RPC

**Binance Smart Chain** is an EVM compatible chain designed to work alongside Binance Chain. \
As well as EVM compatibility, BSC adds smart contract functionality to the chain. The dual-chain architecture alongside Binance Chain enables the sending and receiving of BNB and BEP2 tokens cross-chain.&#x20;

EVM-compatibility permits support for Ethereum tools and DApps.&#x20;
