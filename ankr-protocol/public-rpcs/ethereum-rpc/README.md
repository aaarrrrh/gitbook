# Ethereum RPC

**Ethereum** is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. **Ether** (**ETH**) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform.&#x20;

The Ethereum network is one of the most popular platforms for building dApps and blockchain solutions. A series of upgrades are currently taking place as part of the transition from **Proof-of-Work** to a **Proof-of-Stake** consensus model. This shift allows network participants to stake ETH and earn rewards for supporting the network.&#x20;
