# Nervos RPC

**Nervos** is a blockchain ecosystem with an interesting Multi-Layer Architecture. It has both a Layer 1 (CKB) and a Layer 2 called Godwoken.&#x20;

_**Layer 1 CKB Chain**_ is a public permissionless blockchain using PoW and improved Nakamoto consensus.

_**Layer 2 Godwoken/Polyjuice Chain**_ is a permissionless framework to build scaling solutions on top of Nervos CKB. It is in two parts:\
1\. _Godwoken_ is a permissionless framework to build scaling solutions on top of Nervos CKB. It uses optimistic rollups to address scalability. A set of aggregator nodes perform off-chain transactions then pack them into a CKB transaction onto the CKB layer.&#x20;

_**2**. **** Polyjuice_ adds EVM-compatibility by integrating an EVM engine for running Ethereum Smart Contracts.&#x20;
