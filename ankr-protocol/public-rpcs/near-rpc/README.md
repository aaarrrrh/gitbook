# Near RPC

NEAR is a development platform build on a [sharded](https://near.org/downloads/Nightshade.pdf), [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof\_of\_stake), [layer-one](https://blockchain-comparison.com/blockchain-protocols/) blockchain designed for usability.

NEAR is a decentralized development platform where developers can host serverless applications and smart contracts that easily connect to "open finance" networks and benefit from an ecosystem of "open web"  components.
