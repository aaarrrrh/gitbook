# Connect Wallet

The NEAR Protocol has its own NEAR Wallet. This is an in-browser, web-based wallet for creating and interacting with NEAR accounts.&#x20;

[https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-wallet](https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-wallet)

**Rainbow Bridge** allows the migration of ETH assets to the NEAR platform.&#x20;

Ethereum users can onboard to NEAR using the [ETH Faucet](https://faucet.paras.id), hosted by Paras, and MetaMask.&#x20;

Users must login to MetaMask and prove that their account has a balance higher than 0.05 ETH to  claim a NEAR account and start using the [**Rainbow Bridge**](https://near.org/bridge/#:\~:text=Simply%20by%20logging%20into%20MetaMask,the%20Rainbow%20Bridge%20right%20away.).\
