# Parachain Liquid Bonding Workflow

:one: A user identifies their preferred project and crowdsources DOT to run a Polkadot Parachain crowdloan and participate in the Parachain Slot auction.\
\
&#x20;:two: DOT is allocated to the preferred crowdloan making the user an indirect participant in the crowdloan.

:three: The projects uses the crowdsourced DOT to participate in the Polkadot Parachain Slot auction.

:four: The preferred project wins the slot and auction user are allocated Polkadot Parachain Liquid Bond tokens from the project (aDOTp Project Name) as ERC-20 tokens.  Rewards are distributed during the entire lease period and are calculated based on proof of time. Rewards are distributed as ERC-20 tokens.

### Fees, Rewards and Opportunities

Once the user gets their reward, Ankr charges a **5% fee on the rewards**, from which  **2% goes to Ankr’s corporate treasury** and **3% to Ankr’s buyback program**. \
\
For liquidity, the Parachain Liquid Bonding token holder is able to either sell on the Bounce Finance auction marketplace or collateralize the Parachain Liquid Bonding token and borrow DOT on ONX Finance.

Ankr Bridge provides an Ethereum-Polkadot Parachains Bridge for projects with a Parachain Bond. This allows users to easily bridge their rewards from Parachain Liquid Bonding tokens and Ethereum to the project’s Parachain and vice-versa.
