# Smart Staking

### What is Smart Staking?

Smart Staking is an innovative way to provide a one-click staking experience using liquid staking as collateral to fully represent the staked assets.&#x20;

**Key Benefits**

* One-click staking experience
* Non-custodial staking experience
* Lower staking requirement than staking nodes (e.g. min. 0.5 ETH instead of 32 ETH for one staking node)
* Powered by the most scalable staking infrastructure - liquid staking

**How does it work?**

Deposit ETH or any native token from any Proof-of-Stake blockchain that Ankr supports through liquid staking into a smart contract from Ankr, or your own smart contract if you are a company willing to enable smart staking to your own customers.

The smart contract should then get liquid staking tokens (from Ankr, or the market, whatever is cheaper) when it receives a deposit.

Depositors can withdraw using two options:

1. claim liquid staking token from the smart contract
2. unstake (=smart contract redeems liquid staking token to Ankr) and receive funds at the end of the unbonding period (e.g. every 28 days for aAVAXb, 3-4 days for aMATICb, 7 days for aBNBb)
