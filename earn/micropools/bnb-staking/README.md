# BNB Staking

## BNB Staking

The Binance Chain uses a **proof-of-staked-authority (PoSA**) consensus mechanism updated and operated by 21 validators. Validators must also be elected every 24 hours by **delegators**.&#x20;

**Delegators** are all other members that have **staked BNB tokens**.

It's worth noting that Ankr is consistently voted into the **Top 3 Validators**.
