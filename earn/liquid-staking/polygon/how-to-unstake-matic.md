# How to unstake MATIC

### Intro

To unstake your MATIC, simply choose the '**Unstake'** option at any time on the [StakeFi](https://stakefi.ankr.com/internet-bonds) platform.&#x20;

If you decide to unstake, it can take 3-4 days before you can claim your funds. Throughout this period, your MATIC will continue to **earn staking rewards**.

**Before you start**

Ensure you have **10 ANKR** fee to unstake plus a small (variable) ETH transaction fee approximately **0.0005 ETH**.

Unstaking MATIC tokens is a multi-step process involving sending several transactions to the MATIC smart-contracts deployed in Ethereum.&#x20;

Ankr StakeFi covers the gas fee cost and charge a modest fee in Ankr to compensate its expenses. MATIC tokens are transferred to your wallet automatically when the unstaking process completes. There is no additional cost for this.&#x20;
