# MATIC FAQs

### **Q. What is aMATICb or Polygon liquid staking**

### **A.**

**Polygon Liquid Staking** offers **instant liquidity** for your staked **MATIC**. When you stake MATIC you can claim aMATICb tokens. These can be used with DeFi platforms to potentially earn additional layers of rewards.

aMATICb allows you to earn Alpha. Alpha (α) is a term used to describe a return that beats the normal crypto market. Also known as an excess return.&#x20;

By staking aMATICb tokens on other DeFi platforms there is the potential to earn additional rewards.

### Q. What is the minimum amount of MATIC I can stake?

### A.

The minimum stake is **1 MATIC**.

### Q. If I unstake, is there a lead time before I can access my original MATIC stake or is it immediate?

### A.

Unstaking takes approximately 9 days (80 checkpoints). \


{% hint style="info" %}
**Checkpoints** are a key part of the Matic protocol. They represents snapshots of the chain state and must be verified by ⅔+ of the validator set before they are confirmed and submitted on contracts deployed on Ethereum.
{% endhint %}

### Q. How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

### A.

aMATICb rewards arrive in your wallet with every rebase. Rebasing occurs daily.&#x20;



&#x20;

Q.) How do I receive rewards?

A.) A rebase runs daily and rewards are received each time this runs. You will receive these rewards provided you hold aMATICb in your wallet.

&#x20;

Q.) What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase?

A.) It depends on the average staking period of Ankr Earn validator nodes, as well as MATIC total supply and size of the future instant liquidity pool (indirect cost for aMATICb holders).

&#x20;
