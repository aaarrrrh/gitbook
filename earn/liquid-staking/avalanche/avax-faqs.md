### A.

You can find out how to [Deploy a Smart Contract on Avalanche Using Remix and MetaMask](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask) from Avalanche docs.

### Q. What is the minimum amount of AVAX I can stake?

### A.

1 AVAX

### Q. If I unstake is there a lead time required for this to happen or is it immediate?

### A.

The fair amount of AVAX will be transferred to the user’s wallet at the end of the next staking period, which can take up to 14 days (new staking period every 14 days). The staking rewards between the redemption of aAVAXb and the effective end of the staking period will be credited to the user’s wallet as well.

### Q. How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?

### A.

Your aAVAXb token balance in your wallet will increase with every rebase, rebase occurs daily.

### Q. How do I receive rewards?

### A.

You will see the aAVAXb balance in your wallet increase by a small amount every day in a process called rebasing to reflect your staking rewards.

### Q. Does Ankr charge for the rebasing service?

### A.

Yes - each time a rebase runs, we take a small percentage from this. The percentage is 2%

### Q. How does a user find out current % earnings for AVAX?

### A.

You will be able to see your estimated earnings within the Ankr Earn platform. You can find this amount displayed on the main staking card, and you can also access a rewards calculator to find a more exact number based on the amount you staked.

### Q. What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase?

### A.

This depends on the average staking period of Ankr Earn validator nodes, as well as AVAX total supply and size of the future instant liquidity pool (indirect cost for aAVAXb holders).

### Q. Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?

### A.

Even if the selected node providers are slashed for poorly performing nodes, stakers will always receive their rewards **** from the insurance policies that all node providers must have. This way, stakers face no adverse effects or penalties from slashing while their staked assets are promptly delegated to better nodes.

### Q. Where will my AVAX be staked?&#x20;

### A.

Your AVAX is staked using the Avalanche network (C-Chain) on Ankr Earn and you will automatically receive aAVAXb on the Avalanche network (C-Chain).
